Hi there! This is my personal portfolio website â€” a playful yet professional space where I showcase my work in **web development** and **graphic design**. I built it not just to reflect my skills, but also to experiment with interactive UI and animations.

- Custom SVG hamburger icon with animated full-screen menu
- Smooth scroll-triggered animations (using GSAP)
- Clean typography and layout with a touch of fun
- Project gallery & contact section

---> Tech Stack
