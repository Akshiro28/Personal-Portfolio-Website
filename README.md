# My Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio, a playful yet professional space where I showcase my work in **web development** and **graphic design**. This site was built not only to highlight my skills, but also as an experiment to explore interactive UI, small interactions, and modern web animations.

## Features

- Custom SVG hamburger icon with animated full-screen menu
- Smooth scroll-triggered animations (using GSAP)
- Clean typography and layout with a touch of fun
- Project gallery & contact section

## Tech Stack
